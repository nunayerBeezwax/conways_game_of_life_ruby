=========================

Functioning, GoL... slows with large boards...

This version of Conway's game of life runs in the command line.  It was put together in part during Epicodus, March 14th
by Harland and his partners that day: Alex, Kemonte, Michael, and Corey.  Thanks to all.  

Completed and interfaced by Harland over the weekend.  

It seems to work, it takes an indefinite number of squares (must be coded in at this point) and an indefinite number
of activations from a user and runs though 20 generations (again could be more if coded in). 

Runs pretty smoothly for up to 20x30 boards, at which point it still functions but the animation rendering is 
unacceptably slow.
